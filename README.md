# MiniTwit-with-Web-API
Adding Web Service API to MiniTwit


MiniTwit is an example application that ships with the Flask microframework for Python. It implements a subset of Twitterâ€™s functionality, allowing users to post new messages and follow messages posted by other users

Test Environment
Ubuntu MATE VM 

Steps:
- The MiniTwit application is then reset and dropped the database. 
- Created a file population.sql containing SQL INSERT statements to re-populate the database with test data.
- MiniTwit currently only provides an HTML interface, generated by the server. So I created a new Flask application mt_api.py that exposes RESTful URL endpoints for JSON data, rather than generating HTML.
- Then identified the resources that the Web Service API will need to include and the actions that can be taken for each resource. Then chose appropriate URLs and HTTP Methods for each resources.
- Since all requests to the Web Service API must include all information necessary to complete the request; the API may not use the Flask session object to maintain state between requests. To do this, used the Flask-BasicAuth extension.

To Test:
Since the web browser was used to test only GET methods, to test POST, PUT, and DELETE, used a tool called Postman.
